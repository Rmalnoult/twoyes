  <ul>
    <li>Provide accurate and complete information</li>
    <li>Maintain the security of your account credentials</li>
    <li>Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access</li>
    <li>Accept responsibility for all activity under your account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The TwoYes app, including its design, features, and content, is owned by us and protected by intellectual property laws. The baby name data is compiled from public sources and enriched by our systems. You may not reproduce or distribute app content without our written consent.</p>

  <h2>6. AI-Powered Features</h2>
  <p>TwoYes uses artificial intelligence to provide name recommendations and enrichment data (meanings, origins, famous namesakes). While we strive for accuracy, AI-generated content may occasionally contain errors. Name meanings and cultural information are provided for informational purposes only.</p>

  <h2>7. Partner Matching</h2>

  <h2>8. Subscription and Payments</h2>
  <p>Some features may require a paid subscription. Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and are subject to their respective terms. You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your device's store settings.</p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>TwoYes is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the app will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that any information provided is completely accurate.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, TwoYes shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.</p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the app at any time, with or without cause. You may delete your account at any time through the app settings.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
